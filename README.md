## 📌 Project Overview

This game simulates the *5000 Hydrogen Vehicle Challenge* in collaboration with *Edmonton Global, aimed at educating and engaging users in hydrogen-fueled transportation through interactive gameplay. Built using **Pygame*, the game challenges users to collect fuel cells, unlock hydrogen-powered vehicles, and avoid obstacles within a 5-minute time frame.

The game was showcased to real-world clients and demoed as part of a competition to be presented at the *Canadian Hydrogen Convention 2025*.
